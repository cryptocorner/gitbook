# Token Governance and Voting

Voting requirements for content, tokenomics, royalty changes, marketing wallet uses, dev wallet uses and other requirements we have already set can be updated through a voting request along with using the issued governance tokens of their respective blockchain.&#x20;

There will be a private channel for these votes for governance across all assets.&#x20;

We will make more announcements about this utility in Discord.
