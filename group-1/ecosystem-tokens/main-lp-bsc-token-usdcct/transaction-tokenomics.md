# $CCT - Transaction Tokenomics

**Crytpo Corner Token - $CCT Tokenomics -** Reflection + Automatic LP + Marketing/Development

You don’t have to farm or stake to get more tokens!

The reward amount is conditional upon the volume of the token being traded. This mechanism aims to alleviate some of the downward sell pressure put on the token caused by earlier adopters selling their tokens after farming crazy high APY’s. Second, the reflect mechanism encourages holders to hang onto their tokens to garner higher kick-backs which are based upon a percentages carried out and dependent upon the total tokens held by the owner.

**Marketing and Development Wallet**

Our goal with this is to keep the community going over a long period of time and develop tools and information for the community to use. Our other goal is to have mutual incentive for content providers and content viewers ensuring that both are in line with our growth goals. We want this to last beyond ourselves and this accomplishes the dual ability to also provide development based on our community needs.

**Automatic Liquidity Pool (LP)**

$CCT implements automatic Liquidity Pool with Pancakeswap.finance, which acts as a dual benefit for holders. First, the contract takes tokens from sellers and buyers alike, and adds them to the LP creating a solid price floor. Second, the penalty acts as an arbitrage resistant mechanism that secures the volume of $CCT as a reward for the holders. Basically every trade adds a little liquidity to the underlying marketplace.                        &#x20;
