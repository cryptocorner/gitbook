Ensure you always check which network you are sending your tokens on and that they are the same on both wallets!

Never share your 12 seed phrase with anyone and do not store digitally or send digitally.&#x20;

Hot Wallet = Online / Cold Wallet = Offline ---> Know your Wallets. &#x20;

Recommend Brave Browser or Google Chrome for best experiences online.
