# Content Production Pool Replinishment through Revenue and Sales

Upon sales of assets and revenue from royalites of Collection Project NFT's and EDU Marketplace sales, the content production pool will continuously be re-filled over time. The re-allocation of those funds to their respective pools will follow the same % allocation they were given upon the initial start of the pool.&#x20;

So example is: Links received 10% pool allocation as shown in [.](./ "mention"). When revenue is received that is allocated to the content pool based on the [..](../../ "mention"), the link pool will receive 10% to add to its reserves. So on an so forth with the other content pools.&#x20;
